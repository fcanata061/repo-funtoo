This document is a work-in-progress to describe the workflow through the various
parts of genkernel so that we can split the code into modular chunks.  If you
are interested in helping with genkernel development, please get in touch at
<genkernel@gentoo.org>.

Phases:

- read configs
- source global scripts
- 

Testing things:
  $ cd genkernel
  $ sudo GK_SHARE="$PWD" ./genkernel initramfs --no-install --no-postclear --loglevel=2

Rolling a release:
- Bump the version in the main genkernel file.
- echangelog "Bump version to ${PV}"
- git commit -a -m "Bump version to ${PV}"
- git tag -a -m "Tag release v${PV}" v${PV}
- git push ${REMOTE} master --tags
- make dist
- upload genkernel-${PV}.tar.bz2 to the hosting:
    scp genkernel-${PV}.tar.bz2 ${USER}@dev.gentoo.org:/space/distfiles-local/
- check open bugs with keyword "InSVN" or "InVCS" for closability
