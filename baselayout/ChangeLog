*baselayout-2.1.8 (17 Aug 2010)

  17 Aug 2010; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org> +baselayout-2.1.8.ebuild:
  modprobe.d conf suffixes were accidentally dropped from ebuild - 
  this fixes that issue.

*baselayout-2.1.7 (16 Aug 2010)

  16 Aug 2010; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org> +baselayout-2.1.7.ebuild:
  New baselayout that enables UTF-8 by default (but preserves standard
  LC_COLLATE order so default 'ls' output is less weird.)

*baselayout-2.1.1 (01 Aug 2009)

  01 Aug 2009; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org> +baselayout-2.1.1.ebuild:
  Add .conf suffixes to modprobe.d files.

*baselayout-2.1 (31 Jul 2009)

  31 Jul 2009; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org> +baselayout-2.1.ebuild:
  new baselayout ebuild - rewritten quite a bit - reduced device nodes, more
  .keep files, various changes in core files including an /etc/fstab that
  contains a working sample config with /dev/sda{1,2,3} as boot, swap and
  root respectively. /etc/issue* intentionally removed.

*baselayout-2.0.0 (22 Mar 2008)

  22 Mar 2008; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:
  Now baselayout is just for base files.  All of the init stuff has been forked
  into OpenRC.  For older changelogs, consult svn.
