From udev-166 docs:

The system must have the following group names resolvable at udev startup:
disk, cdrom, floppy, tape, audio, video, lp, tty, dialout, kmem.
Especially in LDAP setups, it is required, that getgrnam() is able to resolve
these group names with only the rootfs mounted, and while no network is
available.
